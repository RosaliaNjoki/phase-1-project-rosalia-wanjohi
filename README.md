## Humburger Restaurant App

This application is the final project of phase-1 at Moringa School. It is meant to learn, practice and fulfil javascript learning requirement in phase-1. The assignment involves fetching API data and using it to make an application. Due to the limitations experienced while working with API data, the app has also integrated json data to empower the writer to attain most of the project evaluation metrics. The app is based on Nutritionix API that contain different foods and nutrition data. It is specifically built on instant endpoint API data, with information on different humbuger receipt. The data is use to display returant menu, giving a few products information including name, thumb photo, serving unit, serving quantity, and id tag. The main essence of importing this data was to create a resturant menu where customers can order and give reviews about their experience with the resturant. However, the API restriction made it hard to achieve this and hence json data came in hand. The app displays the food products from the API, and uses a modified data to permit food ordering, and posting of reviews. The order button is fixed to ensure the serving quantity decreases everytime an order of a specific food is placed. The food items are displayed using cards and grids. API cards are dispayed individually, while json data is displayed as a block. The review for is set separately. THe json data combines two kinds of data, one responsible for ordering and one responsible for holding reveiews.
